# Teacher CUI's Greetings

A teacher friend of mine insisted that I write a software for him. I don't want to say who it is.

## DESCRIPTION

This guy wants to use a remote device to send a message, and the message can be displayed as a floating window on a Windows OS computer on the classroom blackboard screen.

### Windows Client

Developed with electron.   
Full-screen transparent window to show message, with a tray that controls display, hide and exit.
